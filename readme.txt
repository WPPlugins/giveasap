Create a Simple Giveaway or Giveaways and grow your email list. Embed them in a post or in a sidebar to increase the conversion.

== Description ==

Simple Giveaways helps you host giveaways which is entirely what this plugin is all about. You can host them on a separate page and also drive people to it through widgets & shortcodes.

Every giveaway is displayed in a separate template so that your giveaways are loaded as quickly as possible. Other plugins will not affect the loading speed of your giveaway because no scripts or styles are loaded except the ones needed for the giveaway to function.

The Simple Giveaways provides you with many features such as:

 - Choosing the Start Date & Time
 - Choosing the End Date & Time
 - Choosing the Winner Announcement Date & Time
 - Choosing Images which are also sortable
 - Choosing a Logo of the sponsor or yourself
 - Choosing images which will be shared on social media (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest)
 - Editing rules
 - Editing the Winner's email that will be sent when winners are notified
 - Export emails
 - Google Captcha to get rid of spammers
 - Emailing users upon entering with their sharing link 

If you want more control over your giveaway, get the PRO version from the Giveaways Menu. Simple Giveaways Pro version features:

 - Automate the giveaway (process of selecting+notifying winners is all done by WordPress)
 - Choose between different templates (one similar to KingSumo Giveaways)
 - Custom Share Value for Referrals
 - Non-Winner Email: give them a big discount that they won't be able to refuse
